# Rules for contributing
First of all, thank you for using n3-charts ! And thank you too for contributing, this is an open-source, community driven project that couldn't exist without, well, the community. That means you ! However, as any project that involves more than one person, there are rules to follow in order to make everyone happy. Please read them carefully, and feel free to ask about them ([here](https://github.com/n3-charts/line-chart/issues/new)).

## A general rule for this repository, any other repository, and life
Be polite. Seriously, even if english is not your native language, try and be respectful. This can be done easily by following this simple steps :
 1. Proofread what you're about to submit
 2. Don't take open source, free stuff as granted
 3. Use words such as "please", "thank you", "hi"
 4. Close your issue if it's solved
 5. Take it easy :-)

Your requests are less likely to be taken in consideration if you're rude. That being said, most of the people who asked stuff here are pretty cool, this paragraph is just here so that it doesn't change ! :-)

## Asking for new features
Ask for new features in [the issues section](https://github.com/n3-charts/line-chart/issues/new). Please be as explicit and specific as possible, and keep in mind we're only two persons to actively maintain and work on the project (for free). If relevant and well-described (also, if not too hard), your request will be looked into as fast as we can !

## Reporting a bug
Report bugs in [the issues section](https://github.com/n3-charts/line-chart/issues/new). Please use the following structure to make our lives easier ! The better your issue is described (and relevant), the faster it'll be looked into.

### Summary
> Insert here a brief summary of the problem. A good bug summary is "Chart should render the scales when there's no data" or "Errors are visible in the console". Try to narrow down the bug's circumstances by isolating the relevant factors (does this only happen for a specific type of data, or when using the directive in specific conditions ?)

### Expected Behavior
> Good : "the chart should render" or "the tooltip should show up". Bad : "it should work" or "please help".

### Actual Behavior
> Good : "the chart doesn't render" or "the tooltip is invisible". Bad : "it doesn't work" or "I don't understand".

### CodePen Example
> You can start from any example on the [project's examples page](http://n3-charts.github.io/line-chart/#/examples). Click on the icon next to any example's title. It'll open a new CodePen.

### Steps to reproduce the faulty behavior
> Please be specific. Good : "1°) Hover any dot 2°) Hide a series by clicking on the legend 3°) etc.".
